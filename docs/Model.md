# Class Model - Documentation

The Model class represents a convolutional neural network and provides functions for network training and visualization of learned features (sequence/structure motifs). The basic architecture of the network consists of a variable number of convolutional and max pooling layers followed by a variable number of dense layers. These layers are interspersed by dropout layers after the input layer and after every max pooling and dense layer. Network weights in all layers are regularized using a max norm constraint. Early stopping is implemented with respect to the loss on the validation data. 

 The network uses the Adam optimizer. In case of a single-label classification a softmax activation is used for the output layer together with a categorical crossentropy loss. In case of a multi-label classification a sigmoid activation and a binary crossentropy loss is used. All other layers use ReLU activations. 

 The network can be tuned using the following hyperparameters which can be provided through the 'params' parameter of the \_\_init\_\_ function: 

  | parameter         | default | description |  
  |:-                 |:-       |:-           |  
  | conv\_num          | 2       | number of convolutional/pooling layers |  
  | kernel\_num        | 30      | number of kernels in each conv layer |  
  | kernel\_len        | 25      | length of kernels |  
  | pool\_size         | 2       | size of pooling windows |  
  | pool\_stride       | 2       | step size of pooling operation |  
  | dense\_num         | 1       | number of dense layers |  
  | neuron\_num        | 100     | number of neurons in each dense layer |  
  | dropout\_input     | 0.1     | dropout portion after input |  
  | dropout\_conv      | 0.3     | dropout portion after pooling layers |  
  | dropout\_dense     | 0.6     | dropout portion after dense layers |  
  | batch\_size        | 128     | batch size during training |  
  | learning\_rate     | 0.0005  | learning rate of Adam optimizer |  
  | patience\_lr       | 5       | number of epochs without validation loss improvement before halving learning rate |  
  | patience\_stopping | 15      | number of epochs without validation loss improvement before stopping training |  
  | epochs            | 500     | maximum number of training epochs |  
  | kernel\_constraint | 3       | max-norm weight constraint |  
 

 Not all parameters are equally important when doing a hyperparameter grid search. The ones with a strong influence are usually conv\_num (range 1-3), kernel\_num (range 50-300), neuron\_num (50-1000) and the dropout parameters (around 0.1 for the input and 0.2-0.6 otherwise). 

 Note: with each convolutional/pooling stack the length of your sequences will be reduced. E.g. starting with sequences of length 300 and kernels of length 25  will result in sequences of length 300-25+1=276 after the first convolutional layer. A default pooling layer will halve this number further to 138. If you use too many convolutional/pooling stacks you will get an error, because your sequence length will be <= 0. 

 For advanced users we offer the option to add recurrent layers (RNN) between the convolutional and the dense block. Two kinds of layers are possible: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). They can be tuned using the following hyperparameters provided through the 'params' parameter as above: 

  | parameter             | default | description |  
  |:-                     |:-       |:-           |  
  | rnn\_type              | None    | "LSTM" or "GRU" (strings) are possible layers at the moment |  
  | rnn\_num               | 1       | number of RNN layers |  
  | rnn\_units             | 32      | number of output dimensions of each RNN layer |  
  | rnn\_bidirectional     | True    | True or False (bool) whether layers should be bidirectional |  
  | rnn\_dropout\_input     | 0.2     | dropout portion for input connections |  
  | rnn\_dropout\_recurrent | 0.0     | dropout portion for recurrent connections |  
 

 From our experience RNN layers increase the runtime a lot, but the predictive performance only a little or not at all, therefore use them with caution. If you want to get rid of the convolutional or dense block, you can simply set "conv\_num" or "dense\_num" to 0. However, motif visualization will not be possible anymore if the first network layer is not a convolutional layer.

## visualize\_kernel

``` python
def visualize_kernel(self, activations, data, kernel, folder, colors_sequence={}, colors_structure={})
```
Get a number of visualizations and an importane score for a convolutional kernel. 

 This function creates three output files: 1) a sequence(/structure) motif that the kernel has learned to detect, 2) a histogram/activation plot showing the positional enrichment of said motif for every class and 3) violin plots showing the maximum activation distributions for every class (higher values == better, this is a proxy for global class enrichment). 

 The output files are named "motif\_kernel\_x.png", "position\_kernel\_x.png" and "activations\_kernel\_x.png" 

 How it works: Given an input sequence, a first layer kernel produces an output vector (called activations) of length sequence\_length - kernel\_length + 1. The position of the maximum activation can therefore be directly mapped back to the input sequence and a subsequence of the length of the kernel can be extracted from the input sequence. Applying this approach to every input sequence yields a number of subsequences that can be used for the construction of a motif. Subsequences are only considered if the maximum activation exceeds a certain threshold, in this case the maximum of the mean maximum activations per class. Only subsequences from the top class are used to construct the motif (up to 500 subsequences). 

 The histograms show the positions of the maximum activation, i.e. the positions the subsequences were extracted from. The activation plots show the mean activation and standard deviation for all sequence positions. Both plots are only based on sequences that led to a maximum activation higher than the threshold. Histogram and mean activation plot are usually identical, but in case the histogram is very sparse the mean activation plot might be easier to look at. 

 The violin plots show how the maximum activation values are distributed for each class, indicating global class enrichment. 

 The function returns a Motif object (or a tuple of Motif objects for RNA sequence/structure motifs) and an importance score that indicates how important this kernel was for the classification (higher values == more important). The score is computed as maximum of the mean maximum activations per class minus minimum of the mean maximum activations per class. The idea is that kernels that show a big differences across classes (i.e. kernels that are strongly enriched in some classes and little to none in other classes) are more important for the network to deliver correct predictions.

## visualize\_all\_kernels

``` python
def visualize_all_kernels(self, activations, data, folder, colors_sequence={}, colors_structure={})
```
Get visualizations for all first-layer convolutional kernels. 

 This functions creates the same three output files as visualize\_kernel() (see there for details), but for all kernels of the first convolutional layer. It also creates a "summary.html" file showing all plots for each kernel side-by-side. Kernels are sorted by the global importance score. 

 The function returns a list holding Motif objects for each kernel (similar to visualize\_kernel()). This list is not sorted by importance score (i.e. kernel 0 comes first)

| returns | type | description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| results | [pysster.Motif] or [(pysster.Motif, pysster.Motif)] | A list of Motif objects (or a list of tuples of Motifs for sequence/structure cases). |
## plot\_clustering

``` python
def plot_clustering(self, activations, output_file, classes = None)
```
Perform a hierarchical clustering on both sequences and kernels. 

 Given the maximum activations for each sequence - kernel pair (the output of the get\_max\_activations() method) a hierarchical clustering using Ward's method and the Euclidean distance is performed. Values are standardized before clustering. To compute the clustering only for a subset of classes (often it looks quite messy for all classes) you can provide a list of integers through the 'classes' argument (e.g. [0, 3] to only plot sequences belonging to class 0 and 3). By default all sequences of all classes are used. Clustering is only possible for single-label classifications.

|:-|:-|:-|
| activations | dict | A dict with keys 'activations' and 'labels' (the return value of get_max_activations()). |
| output_file | str | Path of the PNG output file. |
| classes | [int] | List of integers indicating which classes should be clustered (default: all). |
## visualize\_optimized\_inputs

``` python
def visualize_optimized_inputs(self, data, layer_name, output_file, bound=0.1, lr=0.02, steps=600, colors_sequence={}, colors_structure={}, nodes=None)
```
Visualize what every node in the network has learned. 

 Given fixed network parameters it is possible to visualize what individual nodes (e.g. kernels in conv layers and neurons in dense layers) have learned during model training by specifically maximizing the output of these nodes with respect to an input sequence (starting with a random PWM of the length of an input sequence). In brief: this function learns a single input sequence (in the form of a PWM) that maximizes the output of a specific network node using a l2-norm penalized gradient ascent optimization. 

 Warning: This kind of visualization has been applied before to image classification networks and while the resulting images are usually somewhat recognizable they are still very hard to interpret (e.g. https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/). For a PWM to be useful it has to be very precise, but this is unfortunately not the case for many data sets and results are very messy, especially for RNA secondary structure motifs. Therefore this function should not be considered for any biological interpretations. Please use the visualize\_kernel() method for more reliable visualizations. Nevertheless, visualization of all layers of a network can be interesting if you are interested in how the neural network works per se. 

 If needed, the bound, lr and steps parameters can be used to tune the information content of the PWM and the convergence of the optimization (higher values == higher information content). 

 Each row in the output file corresponds to a node of the layer.
