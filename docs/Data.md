# Class Data - Documentation

The Data class provides a convenient way to handle bioligcal sequence and structure data for multiple classes. Sequence and structure data are automatically converted into one-hot encoded matrices and split into training/validation/test sets. The data object can then be passed to Grid\_Search or Model objects for easy training and evaluation.

## Methods - Overview

| name | description |
|:-|:-|
| \_\_init\_\_ | Load the sequences and split the data into 70%/15%/15% training/validation/test. |
| train\_val\_test\_split | Randomly split the data into training, validation and test set. |
| load\_additional\_data | Add additional handcrafted numerical or categorical features to the network. |
| get\_labels | Get the labels for a subset of the data. |
| get\_summary | Get an overview of the training/validation/test data for each class. |
## \_\_init\_\_

``` python
def __init__(self, class_files, alphabet, structure_pwm=False)
```
Load the sequences and split the data into 70%/15%/15% training/validation/test. 

 If the goal is to do single-label classification a list of fasta files must be provided (one file per class, the first file will correspond to 'class\_0'). In this case fasta headers are ignored. If the goal is multi-label classification a single fasta file must be provided and headers must indicate class membership as a comma-separated list (e.g. header '\>0,2' means that the entry belongs to class 0 and 2). 

 For sequence-only files fasta entries have no format restrictions. For sequence-structure files each sequence and structure must span a single line, e.g.: 

  \>header  
  CCCCAUAGGGG  
  ((((...))))  
 

 in which the second line contains the sequence and the third line the structure. **Important: All sequences in all files must have the same length.** 

 The provided alphabet must match the content of the fasta files. For sequence-only files a single string (e.g. 'ACGT' or 'ACGU') should be provided and for sequence-structure files a tuple should be provided (e.g. ('ACGU', '().')). Characters that are not part of the provided alphabets will be randomly replaced with an alphabet character. 

 We support all uppercase alphanumeric characters and the following additional characters for alphabets: "()[]{}<\>,.|". Thus, it is possible to use and combine (in the sequence-structure case) arbitrarily defined alphabets as long as the data is provided in the described fasta format. 



| parameter | type | description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| class_files | str or [str] | A fasta file (multi-label) or a list of fasta files (single-label). |
| alphabet | str or tuple(str,str) | A string for sequence-only files and a tuple for sequence-structure files. |
| structure_pwm | bool | Are structures provided as single strings (False) or as PWMs (True)? |
## train\_val\_test\_split

``` python
def train_val_test_split(self, portion_train, portion_val, seed = None)
```
Randomly split the data into training, validation and test set. 

 Example: setting portion\_train = 0.6 and portion\_val = 0.3 will set aside 60% of the data for training, 30% for validation and the remaining 10% for testing. Use the seed parameter to get reproducible splits. 



| parameter | type | description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| portion_train | float | Portion of data that should be used for training (<1.0) |
| portion_val | float | Portion of data that should be used for validation (<1.0) |
| seed | int | Seed for the random number generator. |
## load\_additional\_data

``` python
def load_additional_data(self, class_files, is_categorical=False, standardize=False)
```
Add additional handcrafted numerical or categorical features to the network. 

 For every input sequence additional data can be added to the network (e.g. location, average sequence conservation, etc.). The data will be concatenated to the input of the first dense layer. Input files are text files and must contain one value per line, e.g.: 

  0.679  
  0.961  
  0.065  
  0.871  
  ...  
 

 The number of provided files must match the fasta files provided to the \_\_init\_\_ function (e.g. if you provided a list of 3 files to \_\_init\_\_ you must provide a list of 3 files here as well) and the number of lines in each file must match the number of entries in the correspoding fasta file. If you want to add multiple features simply call this function multiple times. 

 Interpreting the influence of arbitrary additional data for a neural network is hard and at the moment we don't provide any means to do so. You should run your model with and without the additional data and check if the predictive performance improves. In general, if you have many handcrafted features you might want to consider using a different machine learning technique. 



| parameter | type | description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| class_files | str or [str] | A text file (multi-label) or a list of text files (single-label). |
| is_categorical | bool | Is the provided data categorical or numerical? |
| standardize | bool | Should the z-score be computed for numerical data? |
## get\_labels

``` python
def get_labels(self, group)
```
Get the labels for a subset of the data. 

 The 'group' argument can have the value 'train', 'val', 'test' or 'all'. The returned array has the shape (number of sequences, number of classes). 



| parameter | type | description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| group | str | A string indicating for which subset the labels should be returned. |

| returns | type | description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| labels | numpy.ndarray | An array filled with 0s and 1s indicating class membership. |
## get\_summary

``` python
def get_summary(self)
```
Get an overview of the training/validation/test data for each class. 




| returns | type | description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| summary | str | A tabular overview of every class. |
