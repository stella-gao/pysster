### Learning Sequence And Structure Motifs In Biological Sequences Using Convolutional Neural Networks

pysster is a Python package for training and interpretation of convolutional neural networks on biological sequence data. Sequences are classified by learning sequence and structure motifs and the package offers sensible default parameters, an optional hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize learned motifs. The main features of the package are:

* multi-class and single-label or multi-label classifications
* sensible default parameters and an optional hyper-parameter tuning
* learning of motifs + interpretation in terms of positional and class enrichment and motif co-occurrence
* support of input strings over user-defined alphabets (e.g. applicable to DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.)
* optional use of structure information, handcrafted features and recurrent layers
* seamless CPU or GPU computation

The preprint can be found on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/06/230086).

If you run into bugs, missing documentation or if you have a feature request, feel free to open an issue.

### Installation

pysster is compatible with Python 3.5+ and can be installed via pip or github.

**Install via pip:**

```sh
pip3 install pysster
```
**Install latest version via github:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/budach/pysster.git
cd pysster
pip3 install .
```

### Using the GPU

pysster depends on TensorFlow and by default the CPU version of TensorFlow will be installed. If you want to use your NVIDIA GPU (which is recommended for large data sets or grid searchs) make sure that your CUDA and cuDNN drivers are correctly installed and then install the GPU version of TensorFlow:

```sh
pip3 uninstall tensorflow
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
```

By the time of writing the most recent TensorFlow version is 1.4.0 and requires CUDA 8 and cuDNN 6. You can always check the required versions in the TensorFlow [release notes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases).
